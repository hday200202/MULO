#MDAW
 Modular DAW empowers users to build and tailor their own audio production environment. Inspired by modern software development tools and professional audio platforms, 
 it supports user-defined plugins, workspace arrangement, and project management.

Use case and How we started on it:
Harrison, a music producer, launches the app, downloads a few extensions, arranges his workspace, saves the setup, and starts producing. 
The next day, he resumes his project with all components in place—exactly how he left it.
